**What works:**
Wifi works 5Ghz/2Mhz (doesn't support WPA3 networks for some reason though)
Bluetooth (Sometimes stops working after sleep, but re-entering and exiting sleep fixes it)
Sleep 
iMessage/Facetime Works (make sure to generate your own unique SMBIOS)
Screen Mirroring Works
Hdmi

**What doesn't work:**
Mute button on the keyboard (only graphically, currently working on a fix) 
Airdrop (requires different wifi card, but wifi card on xps 13 7390 is soldered on)
